# @mrcaidev/cue

Cue is a minimal MVVM framework, heavily inspired by [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/core).

It implements two-way binding between View layer and Model layer, and supports Vue-like mustaches and directives.

This project wins me the first place among 2,767 participants in Baidu Frontend Summer Workshop 2022. üèÜ
